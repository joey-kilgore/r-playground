# r-playground
Various R scripts. 

Many related to analysis of [Nerve-Block-Modeling](https://github.com/joey-kilgore/Nerve-Block-Modeling/) or [kaccumulation](https://github.com/joey-kilgore/kaccumulation)  

These scripts are relatively scattered and some are more documented than others. R can be an excellent exploratory tool, and this repository is setup for that mindset. More specific and directed scripts will be given their own repository. Additionally, this repo will probably not contain any of the data needed for the scripts, and likely won't include the output graphs.
